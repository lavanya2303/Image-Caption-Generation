"An Image Caption Description" is a written caption that explains the important details of a picture. It involves generating a human readable textual description given an image, such as a photograph. For a human, it is a very simple task, but for a computer it is extremely difficult since it requires both understanding the content of an image and how to translate this understanding into natural language.

In this project, we use CNN (VGG16 model) and LSTM to generate the caption of the image. As the deep learning techniques are growing, huge datasets and computer power are helpful to build models that can generate captions for an image. This is what we are going to implement in this Python based project where we will use deep learning techniques like CNN and RNN.
